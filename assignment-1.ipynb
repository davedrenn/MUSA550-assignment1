    "# Assignment #1: The Donut Effect for Philadelphia ZIP Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will practice our `pandas` skills and explore the [\"Donut Effect\"](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/donut-effect-how-covid-19-shapes-real-estate) within Philadelphia. The \"Donut Effect\" describes the following phenomenon: with more flexible working options and pandemic-driven density fears, people left urban dense cores and opted for more space in city suburbs, driving home and rental prices up in the suburbs relative to city centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with [Zillow data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) for the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for Philadelphia ZIP codes. The goal will be to calculate home price appreciation in Philadelphia, comparing those ZIP codes in Center City (the central business district) to those not in Center City."
